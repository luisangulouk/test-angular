Estimation
----------
Estimated: 22 hours

20 - development / 2 hours - inital testing
The estimation is based on: wireframe provided

Spent: x hours

26 (hours)
Including 4 hours of sandbox on angular >= 2 -- I was a bit out of shape since I haven't worked in Angular for about a year, the experience has been very rewarding, this type of projects would be developed and implemented faster once I've worked on the first version


Solution
--------
Improvements
-Implement custom pipe to search on current view
-Add dynamic number of results per pages
-Since there are a big number of fields for each profile, implement a mechanism to include specific non critical fields
-Add drag and drop image on profiles
-Add validation -- autocomplete for fields like language and Country
